# Transformer-Chatbot
Intro:

At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.
For this assignment, we will be building a chatbot that will be trained on Cornell movie dialogue corpus that can chat like movie characters.
